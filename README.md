# Geospatial-Data-Visualization-and-Analysis

This project collects, processes, and visualizes geospatial data for 13 locations. The key components include:

Spatial Data Collection: Gathered and created spatial data, visualized using Google Earth through a KML file.
Spatial Analysis: Leveraged Postgres with PostGIS extensions to perform spatial queries, including computing convex hulls and identifying nearest neighbors.
Data Visualization: Employed OpenLayers JavaScript API for interactive browser-based visualizations and ArcGIS for advanced shapefile visualizations.
This project demonstrates the integration of geospatial technologies for comprehensive spatial analysis and visualization.
